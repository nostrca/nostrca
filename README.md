## Q & A

**Is it free?**

_Yes!_

**Why?**

_Why not?_

**Is a free service sustainable?**

_Everything is hosted on GitHub Pages and no costs are incurred._

**Does that mean the service could get shut down at some point?**

_If GitHub Pages doesn't work out I'll try this from a VPS, but if the costs get out of hand, yes, it's possible that the service could shut down. This is another reason it's completely free_

**How can we help keep the service sustainable?**

_Although there's no cost, we wouldn't be sad if people wanted to zap a few sats to nostr@nostr.ca._

**Are you affiliated with the Nostr protocol or nostr.com?**

_Absolutely not, just a Nostr fan that's trying to help expand the ecosystem._
